# ReportGeneration
Scripts to generate reports


To use the kivy report generation app, install python and kivy, then create a virtual environment to launch the app. For instructions see the following link: https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html?highlight=virtual%20env.

The first instantiation takes user input for a directory to investigate for recently modified files and a path to export the report.

Suggestions and Tips are welcome and appreciated.
